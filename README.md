# Oscillation-Parameters-Short-Loops
This repository contains oscillation parameters from the Solar Orbiter/HRIEUV datasets in .csv format. It includes two tables: one for oscillations in short loops within active regions, and another for those in the quiet Sun and coronal holes, as published in Shrivastav et al. (2024).
